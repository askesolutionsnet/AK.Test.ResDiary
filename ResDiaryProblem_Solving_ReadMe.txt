Problem:
The goal is to divide the input array into N equally sized arrays, and if the size of the original array cannot be divided equally by N, the final part should have a length equal to the remainder.

Explanation:

1- The GroupArrayElements function takes an input array and a positive integer N as arguments.
2- It first checks if N is a positive integer greater than zero, throwing an exception if not.
3- The variable arraySize holds the length of the input array.
4- The variable chunkSize calculates the size of each chunk, ensuring that the last chunk has the remainder elements if the array cannot be divided equally.
5- I create a list of lists (result) to store the divided arrays.
6- The loop divides the array into chunks and adds each chunk to the result.
7- Finally, the function returns the list of divided arrays.


Note: This implementation follows real-world practices, including input validation, readable variable names, and clear comments to explain the logic.

To test the implementation, you can use the provided Main method in the Program class. Just replace inputArray and N with your desired values.
